Mail from Damian Rochman :
I uploaded two builds for you:
Build 10 that you should be able to install: https://www.dropbox.com/s/lq7v53m3gbt3qfn/MediaSpace-5.0.10.tar.gz
Build 12 where the install doesn't work https://www.dropbox.com/s/fammpvatv6p7j1o/MediaSpace-5.0.12.tar.gz
After installing build 10, take the config.ini from [root]/config and copy it to your expanded folder of build 12. You should be able to access the URL of build 12 without the need to install
Let me know if you have any problems.
